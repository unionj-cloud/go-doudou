	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	nameCmd.Flags().StringVarP(&file, "file", "f", "", "absolute path of vo file")
	nameCmd.Flags().StringVarP(&strategy, "strategy", "s", "lowerCaseNamingStrategy", "name of strategy")
	nameCmd.Flags().BoolVarP(&omitempty, "omitempty", "o", false, "whether omit empty value or not")
